        <h3>Who is the course instructor</h3>
        <p>Trevor</p>

        <h3>Who is your class tutor</h3>
        <p>Sachin</p>

        <h3>Have you any programming or web design experience?</h3>
        <p>I have a few courses worth of programming experience and have made websites in the past for various projects
          during my studies. I have studied Webdesign during my diploma course and am already familiar with the
          language. Also, I have prior experience with PHP and Javascript, used primarily in Webdesign.</p>

        <h3>Do you see yourself as a programmer, designer, or both?</h3>
        <p>I enjoy programming and design, and I see myself capable of both. I love the feeling of designing and then
          adding logic to it, and Suddenly, the design becomes a responsive application that works and is interactable.
        </p>

        <h3>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</h3>
        <p>Web programming is fundamental in the IT world. This course is an excellent opportunity to learn more about
          it and get more comfortable designing and programming web-based programs. Primarily I'm curious to know more
          about PHP, Javascript, and other web development frameworks. </p>

        <h3>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</h3>
        <p>By the end of this course, I hope to be comfortable with Javascript, PHP and have a fair knowledge of hosting
          websites on a server. Also, I'm hoping to understand the web development frameworks better by the end of this
          course, mainly Django and React. </p>

        <h3>What websites do you use the most?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Here is a list of my favourite websites:</li>
          <li><a href='https://www.codecademy.com/' target='_blank'>https://www.codecademy.com</a></li>
          <li><a href='https://www.freeconvert.com' target='_blank'>https://www.freeconvert.com</a></li>
          <li><a href='https://coolors.co' target='_blank'>https://coolors.co</a></li>
          <li><a href='https://www.pinterest.com.au' target='_blank'>https://www.pinterest.com.au</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</h3>
        <p>One of my hobbies is reading fictional novels. I also visit Codecademy regularly to learn programming
          languages that I am most interested in, and I enjoy learning them. Besides reading books and programming, I go
          to the gym and walk my dog daily.</p>
